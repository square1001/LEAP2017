    <h1>What's this restaurant?</h1>
    <p>  This restaurant started in July 19th on 2017, by Hirotaka Yoneda, for the Codemakers++ program in L.E.A.P McMaster University.
      In this program, we write HTML and CSS source code, so I decided to make a restaurant to make website :) </p>
    <p>  I like desserts, so this restaurant has some desserts including cakes, donuts, and fruits.
      Of course we have some drinks! I really hope you enjoy eating and drinking! </p>
    <p> Please see <a href="general-info.html">General Information Page</a> to know where the restaurant located, when is opened, and how to contact us. </p>
